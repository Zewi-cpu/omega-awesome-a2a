**Category**: Multimodal AI - Video Understanding
**Publication Date**: December 2023
**Paper Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05616

**Innovation Summary**: 
MM-VID presents a zero-shot framework that transforms GPT-4V's image understanding capabilities into sophisticated video analysis through intelligent frame sampling and temporal reasoning, requiring no additional training.

**Technical Details**:
- Architecture combines frame sampling strategies with prompt engineering
- Key Components:
  - Frame Extraction Module (uniform/keyframe sampling)
  - GPT-4V Analysis Pipeline
  - Temporal Reasoning Framework
  - Answer Synthesis Module
- Zero-shot operation without fine-tuning requirements

**Implementation Notes**:
- Requires GPT-4V API access
- Frame extraction implementable via OpenCV
- Prompt templates available in paper Section 3.2
- Performance achieved with 8-16 sampled frames per video

**Why It Matters for A2A Systems**:
Demonstrates how existing vision-language models can be adapted for complex video understanding without specialized training, providing a blueprint for extending other image-based AI systems to temporal domains.
